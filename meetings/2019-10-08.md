## News from the team

The old bastion instance is now terminated. All connections to our
infrastructure will have to go through [the new
one](https://github.com/rust-lang/infra-team/blob/master/docs/hosts/bastion.md).

## Rotating who runs the triage meetings (aidanhs/pietroalbini)

Aidan wanted to offload who runs the weekly triage meetings, and pietroalbini
finds a bit difficult to run all the meetings as he’s the one proposing most of
the topics, which makes steering the discussion to a conclusion harder. The
proposal aidanhs came to the meeting with was to instead rotate who runs the
meeting amongst all members of the team.

While there was some skepticism (running meetings is hard, and not everyone
attends all the meetings) we decided to try rotating who runs the meetings for
the next month, and then revisit the proposal in a month given the experience
we had. At the end of the meeting we’ll find a volunteer to run the next one,
considering who hasn’t run any meeting in a while and each one’s personal
schedule.
