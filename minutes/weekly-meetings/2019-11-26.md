## Nominated: PR Drop python2

PR [#66605](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/66605) adds Python 3 support
to the last Python 2-only scripts in our repository. Most of those scripts are
under infra responsibility. We agreed that as long as Python 2 is not
intentionally broken by the changes we’re fine landing the PR.

## Nominated: sysroot spans are not printed on some targets

PR [#53081](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/53081) was nominated, but
it wasn’t clear what the infrastructure involvment on it was.

## GitHub Actions progress

pietroalbini’s WIP branch has all the Linux builders green, while Windows is
failing.
