# Bastion server

* FQDN: `bastion.infra.rust-lang.org`
* [Ansible playbook][ansible] to deploy this server.
* [Metrics][grafana] (only available to infra team members).

## Logging into servers through the bastion

To improve the security of our infrastructure it's not possible to connect
directly to a production server with SSH. Instead, all connections must come
from a small server called the "bastion", which only allows connections from a
few whitelisted networks and logs any connection attempt.

To log into a server through the bastion you can use SSH's `-J` flag:

```
ssh -J bastion.infra.rust-lang.org servername.infra.rust-lang.org
```

It's also possible to configure SSH to always jump through the bastion when
connecting to a host. Add this snippet to your SSH configuration file (usually
located in `~/.ssh/config`):

```
Host servername.infra.rust-lang.org
    ProxyJump bastion.infra.rust-lang.org
```

Please remember the bastion server only allows connections from a small list of
IP addresses. Infra team members with AWS access can change the whitelist, but
it's good practice to either have your own bastion server or a static IP
address.

The SSH keys authorized to log into each account are stored in the [simpleinfra
repository][keys]. Additionally, people with sensitive 1password access can use
the master key stored in the vault to log into every account, provided their
connection comes from any whitelisted IP.

## Common maintenance procedures

### Adding a new user to the bastion server

To add a new user to the bastion you need to add its key to a file named
`<username>.pub` in [`ansible/roles/common/files/ssh-keys`][keys], and change
the [Ansible playbook][ansible] adding the user to the list of unprivileged
users. Please leave a comment clarifying which servers the user will have
access to.

Once that's done [apply the playbook][ansible-apply] and [add a new whitelisted
IP address](#updating-the-whitelisted-ips).

### Updating the whitelisted IPs

To change the IP whitelist go to the [EC2 security groups
console][ec2-security-groups] and click on the `rust-prod-bastion` security
group. Its details should appear on the bottom: go to the "Inbound" tab and
click "Edit". Make the changes and click "Save".

Make sure every rule has the person who owns the IP address in the description!
